## Accessing QwikLabs & AWS environment



Fortinet Cloud Workshops, will use [**QwikLabs**](https://fortinet.qwiklabs.com/paths) to provide a pre-staged AWS account with the workshop environment.

- Upon login, click **Dashboard** (top of page).
- Find and select **FortiGate: Protecting AWS Resources**.
- Click the green **Start Lab** button to begin.

{{% notice warning %}}
Provisioning the lab can take 15 minutes or more once started. This environment will run for 3 hours and then automatically shutdown and delete all resources. If you restart the lab, you will start with a clean environment where you must start from the beginning again.

Once the environment has finished provisioning, check the QwikLabs Console left menu to find your AWS login URL and credentials, along with other useful information you will need throughout your lab. You may now procede to the [hands-on section of the lab]({{< relref "3_modulethree/_index.md" >}}).
